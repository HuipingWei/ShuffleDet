- Download KITTI object detection dataset: [images](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_object_image_2.zip) and [labels](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_object_label_2.zip). Put them under `$SQDT_ROOT/data/KITTI/`. Unzip them, then you will get two directories:  `$SQDT_ROOT/data/KITTI/training/` and `$SQDT_ROOT/data/KITTI/testing/`. 

- Now we need to split the training data into a training set and a vlidation set. 

  ```Shell
  cd $SQDT_ROOT/data/KITTI/
  mkdir ImageSets
  cd ./ImageSets
  ls ../training/image_2/ | grep ".png" | sed s/.png// > trainval.txt
  ```
  `trainval.txt` contains indices to all the images in the training data. In our experiments, we randomly split half of indices in `trainval.txt` into `train.txt` to form a training set and rest of them into `val.txt` to form a validation set. For your convenience, we provide a script to split the train-val set automatically. Simply run
  
    ```Shell
  cd $SQDT_ROOT/data/
  python random_split_train_val.py
  ```
  
  then you should get the `train.txt` and `val.txt` under `$SQDT_ROOT/data/KITTI/ImageSets`. 

  When above two steps are finished, the structure of `$SQDT_ROOT/data/KITTI/` should at least contain:

  ```Shell
  $SQDT_ROOT/data/KITTI/
                    |->training/
                    |     |-> image_2/00****.png
                    |     L-> label_2/00****.txt
                    |->testing/
                    |     L-> image_2/00****.png
                    L->ImageSets/
                          |-> trainval.txt
                          |-> train.txt
                          L-> val.txt
